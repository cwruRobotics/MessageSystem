In this project you will find several sub-projects, each of which represents how clients
generally develop different parts of a robot system as different projects.

Each project is linked to Robos, and eventually is all linked together into a main
function. This functionality should be provided by the build system, but isnt yet, so
this should help to illustrate the tutorials in the /manual/forClients/Tutorials directory.
