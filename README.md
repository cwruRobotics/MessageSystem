To build this project, you need (well I used) Python 2.7.10 and you NEED AT LEAST CMake 3.3 OR IT WILL FAIL
BECAUSE I'VE SET IT THAT WAY.

You will also need either GCC or Visual Studio. I'm using Visual Studio 15 but I think the build process
is generic enough that it will detect your version of Visual Studio and use it when calling CMake.
