In Robos, there are several types of Nodes, each having different
functionality (this list will grow as more languages are embedded):

-InitNodeBase:
	There need to be Nodes that do not subscribe to any message topics.
	These Nodes just continuously pump out messages, and are assumed
	to run at max for as long as Robos is running. If your code is designed
	to be the "source" of something, then this is the class you want to
	extend to wrap your code. Please see "Extending_InitNodeBase.txt"

-NodeBase:
	This Node type has the typical subscription and publishing functionality.
	Nodes of this type receive data from somewhere, compute something, and
	push out more data for others to operate on. Note that Nodes of this
	type can be the "end" of an execution chain, and can publish a "null"
	message in which nothing happens. Please see "Extending_Nodebase.txt"

-PyNodeBase:
	This Node type is the exact same as NodeBase except that Nodes of this
	type wrap service calls into embedded Python. If your code is written
	in Python, you MUST extend this Node type. Please see
	"Using_Robos_With_Python.txt" and "Extending_PyNodeBase.txt"
