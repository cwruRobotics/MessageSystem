Welcome to developing for CWRUBotix!

This project is basically an Operating System, but I feel a little more comfortable
calling it an Execution Environment. The only reason I say this is because the code
we are writing is not bootable (you still need an actual OS to run the damn thing)
but we're as close as we can get to a fully fledged OS.

Anyways, this document should be your guide to exactly what is going on, from the
high level concepts down to the low level, and should explain everything from
the actual code we are writing to the code that allows you to build the code
we are writing.

I recommend you read the following documents in the following order (these documents
should be in the current directory):

# code that lets us build our project code:
1) buildProcess.txt
2) ourBuildProcess.txt

# C++ skill and topics:
3) BasicCPPTopicsYouShouldKnow.txt
4) AdvancedCPPTopicsYouShouldKnow.txt

# project code:
5) Logging.txt
6) AsynchronousProgramming.txt
7) FuturesFramework.txt
8) InformationDependentExecution.txt
9) MessageFramework.txt

10) HowToContribute.txt

I think thats it! This list will grow as necessary, or if anyone wants to add their own documents!
Remember, there is a lot of stuff here, don't be intimidated or discouraged, you can do this!
